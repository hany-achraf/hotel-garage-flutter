/// Inside our JsonConverter, T and S are used like so:
///
/// T fromJson(S)
/// S toJson(T)
///
/// T is the concrete class type we're expecting out of fromJson() calls.
/// It's also the concrete type we're inputting for serialization in toJson() calls.
///
/// Most commonly, T will just be T: a variable type passed to JsonConverter in our
/// Object being serialized, e.g. the "T" from OperationResult<T> above.
///
/// S is the JSON type.  Most commonly this would Map<String,dynamic>
/// if we're only de/serializing single objects.  But, if we want to de/serialize
/// Lists, we need to use "Object" instead to handle both a single object OR a List of objects.
